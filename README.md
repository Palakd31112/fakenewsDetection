Project: Fake News Detection
Description:
Developed a machine learning model to identify and classify misleading or false news articles. Collected and preprocessed news datasets, applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization. Implemented classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Deployed the model with a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.

Key Skills & Tools: Python, NLP, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
